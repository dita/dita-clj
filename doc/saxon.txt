### Saxon

DITA-OT depends on some saxon libraries.  The author of Saxon does not
make the open source version available as a maven artifact; the ones
you can find in various maven libraries have been uploaded by other
people, against the author's wishes.  Usually they're out of date as
well.

To use saxon with leiningen you should download it from Sourceforge and
do your own config.  One way to do this is to create a local maven
artifact for installation to your local maven repo
(~/.m2/repository). [This
post](http://nakkaya.com/2010/03/16/adding-custom-libraries-into-local-leiningen-repository/)
show's how:

	mvn install:install-file \
		-Dfile=saxon9he.jar \
		-DgroupId=usr.local \
		-DartifactId=saxon \
		-Dversion=9.5.1.2J \
		-Dpackaging=jar \
		-DgeneratePom=true

Then add the following to your project dependency:

    [usr.local/saxon "9.5.1.2J"]
